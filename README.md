# edocker.mk
An erlang linux release/docker image builder 

# inspiration
The origin of the build scripts in the bin folder and the inspiration comes from Peter Morgan's [Erlang in Docker From Scratch repo](https://github.com/shortishly/erlang-in-docker-from-scratch). The work in this
repo is to integrate that way of building of erlang docker images nicely with
erlang.mk in a reusable manner.

# documentation
So far this is just a test that is probably not that useful to others.
If it gets to a stage where others might want to use it I will update this
README with usage instructions.
